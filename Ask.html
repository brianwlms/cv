      <li>Businesses should not directly ask customers what they want because customers often do not know. Businesses need to devise ways to ask customers other questions that offer clues as to what they might want.</li>
      <li>Surveys that ask the right questions at the right time are valuable to businesses.</li>
      <li>The key to optimal survey implementation is asking the right indirect questions to find out what customers want to hear.</li>
      <li>Part of the success of the Ask Formula and marketing in general is determining the type of language that people want to hear.</li>
      <li>A sales funnel is integral to a business' overall sales strategy by changing sutomers from leads to buyers. A survey funnel lines up the sales funnel with the surveys, ultimately helping the customer move through the sales funnel and closer to buying  a business' product.</li>
      <li>One of the biggest mistakes a business can make is to assume it knows everything about its market without doing the necessary research and surveying to properly study the market.</li>
      <li>Through the Ask Formula surveys, businesses can ensure they determine the right products for their market and funnel customers to the correct categories based on their needs. The surveys establish this process from the beginning, but later surveys can also catch and correct any mistakes when classifying customers.</li>
      <li>The Ask Formula at its core is all about psychology. The surveys themselves are meant to appeal to certain psychological sentiments, and the marketing language devised from the surveys affects customers' psychology and interpretation of a business' product.</li>
